# Server Issue Report - 2025-06-30

## Issue Summary
Server and database were unexpectedly down after committing HTML metadata changes. Server startup process appears to have reliability issues that need investigation.

## Timeline of Events

### Issue Discovery (15:14:00 -07:00)
**User Report**: "page is no longer rendering. check server and db"

### Initial Diagnosis
**Commands Run:**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/health || echo "Server not responding"
# Result: Server not responding

docker ps | grep postgres || echo "Database container not found"  
# Result: Database container not found

ps aux | grep node | grep -v grep || echo "No Node processes found"
# Result: No Node processes found (only VS Code processes running)
```

**Finding**: Both server and database were completely down despite successful commit with pre-commit health checks passing.

### Recovery Process

#### Step 1: Database Recovery
```bash
docker-compose up -d
# Successfully started PostgreSQL container
```

#### Step 2: Server Startup Attempts
**Attempt 1 - Normal Dev Start:**
```bash
sleep 3 && npm run dev
# Command timed out after 2m 0.0s
# Server appeared to start but hung during process
```

**Attempt 2 - Emergency Recovery:**
```bash
npm run emergency
# Command timed out after 2m 0.0s Terminated
# Emergency recovery also hung
```

**Attempt 3 - Simple Mode:**
```bash
npm run dev:simple
# Command timed out after 2m 0.0s
# Again hung despite showing startup messages
```

**Attempt 4 - Direct Node Start:**
```bash
node dist/server/index.js &
# Command timed out after 2m 0.0s
# But server actually started successfully in background
```

### Final Resolution
Server was actually running despite command timeouts. Health checks confirmed:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/health
# {"status":"ok","database":"connected","timestamp":"2025-06-30T22:22:33.779Z"}

curl -s http://localhost:3000/ | head -5
# HTML page rendered correctly with updated metadata
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Symptoms Observed
1. **Silent Failure**: Server and DB stopped without obvious trigger
2. **Command Timeouts**: All npm scripts hung for 2+ minutes
3. **Misleading Output**: Server showed startup messages but commands timed out
4. **Background Success**: Direct node command worked when backgrounded

### Potential Causes
1. **Process Management**: npm scripts may have process hanging issues
2. **Port Conflicts**: Previous processes may not have cleaned up properly
3. **Resource Contention**: Memory or CPU issues during commit process
4. **Signal Handling**: Improper process termination during pre-commit checks

### Context
- Issue occurred immediately after successful commit: `2981331`
- Pre-commit health checks passed (4.1s startup time reported)
- No code changes to server logic, only HTML metadata updates
- Docker containers stopped unexpectedly

## Current Workarounds

### Reliable Startup Method
```bash
# 1. Start database
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Start server in background
node dist/server/index.js &

# 3. Verify health
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Port Cleanup
```bash
# Kill processes on port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || echo "Port 3000 is free"

# Kill specific server processes  
pkill -f "node.*dist/server" || echo "No processes killed"
```

## Recommendations for Investigation

### High Priority
1. **Review npm script process management** - Why do they hang?
2. **Investigate pre-commit test side effects** - Does health check leave processes?
3. **Add timeout handling** to development scripts
4. **Improve error reporting** in startup scripts

### Medium Priority  
1. **Process monitoring** - Add health checks that detect hung states
2. **Graceful shutdown** - Ensure clean process termination
3. **Resource monitoring** - Check for memory/CPU issues during startup
4. **Container stability** - Why did containers stop unexpectedly?

### Immediate Improvements
1. Add process timeout handling to npm scripts
2. Implement better error messages for hung processes
3. Create reliable startup script that detects and handles issues
4. Add monitoring to detect when services go down

## Files to Review
- `package.json` - npm script definitions
- `scripts/check-port.js` - port checking logic
- `src/__tests__/infrastructure/pre-commit-startup.test.ts` - health check behavior
- `docker-compose.yml` - container configuration

## Status
- **Immediate Issue**: Resolved (server and DB running)
- **Root Cause**: Unknown - requires investigation
- **Risk Level**: Medium - could impact development workflow
- **Next Steps**: Schedule debugging session to improve server reliability

## Additional Server Startup Issues - 2025-06-30 16:15:00 -07:00

### Issue Context
During React Testing Library integration commit and subsequent server restart attempts, encountered similar server startup reliability issues.

### Timeline of Additional Issues

#### React Testing Library Commit (16:09:00)
**User Request**: "start the database and the server and render the index page"

#### Database Startup (16:09:00)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
# ✅ Success: Container zentropy_db Running
```

#### Server Startup Issues (16:09:00 - 16:13:00)
**Attempt 1 - Build with Linting:**
```bash
npm run dev:simple
# ❌ Failed: Build stopped at linting step due to 315 existing TypeScript errors
# Note: These are legacy codebase errors, not related to React changes
```

**Attempt 2 - Manual Build:**
```bash
npm run build:client && npm run build:server
# ✅ Success: React app built to dist/public, server built to dist/server
```

**Attempt 3 - Direct Server Start:**
```bash
node dist/server/index.js
# ❌ Issue: Command showed startup messages but timed out after 10s
# Server appeared to start but command hung
```

**Attempt 4 - Connection Test:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# ❌ Failed: Connection refused - server not actually listening
```

**Attempt 5 - Background Process:**
```bash
nohup node dist/server/index.js > server.log 2>&1 & 
# ✅ Success: Server started properly with PID 28930
# ✅ Verified: React app served correctly at http://localhost:3000/
# ✅ Health check: {"status":"ok","database":"connected"}
```

### Pattern Analysis

#### Consistent Issues
1. **npm script hanging**: Both `npm run dev:simple` and direct `node` commands hang
2. **Misleading output**: Server shows startup messages but doesn't actually listen
3. **Background success**: Starting server with `&` or `nohup` works reliably
4. **Process management**: Foreground processes appear to get stuck after startup messages

#### New Observations
1. **Build pipeline isolation**: React client builds work fine, issue is server startup
2. **Linting blocker**: 315 legacy TypeScript errors block `npm run build` command
3. **Express + React integration**: Static file serving works once server actually starts
4. **Resource contention**: Foreground processes seem to hang waiting for something

### Confirmed Workaround Pattern
```bash
# Reliable startup sequence:
docker-compose up -d                    # Start database
npm run build:client && npm run build:server  # Build without linting
nohup node dist/server/index.js > server.log 2>&1 &  # Background server
curl http://localhost:3000/health       # Verify startup
```

### Additional Investigation Areas
1. **npm script process handling** - Why do foreground processes hang?
2. **Express startup timing** - What is the server waiting for?
3. **Signal handling in WSL2** - Are there platform-specific issues?
4. **Memory/resource monitoring** - Is the process running out of resources?
5. **Legacy codebase TypeScript errors** - Blocking build pipeline reliability

### Immediate Action Items
1. Create bypass for linting in development builds (legacy codebase errors)
2. Add timeout and error handling to npm scripts
3. Investigate why foreground node processes hang after startup
4. Document reliable startup sequence for development team
