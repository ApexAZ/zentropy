# Server Issue Report - 2025-06-30

## Issue Summary
Server and database were unexpectedly down after committing HTML metadata changes. Server startup process appears to have reliability issues that need investigation.

## Timeline of Events

### Issue Discovery (15:14:00 -07:00)
**User Report**: "page is no longer rendering. check server and db"

### Initial Diagnosis
**Commands Run:**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/health || echo "Server not responding"
# Result: Server not responding

docker ps | grep postgres || echo "Database container not found"  
# Result: Database container not found

ps aux | grep node | grep -v grep || echo "No Node processes found"
# Result: No Node processes found (only VS Code processes running)
```

**Finding**: Both server and database were completely down despite successful commit with pre-commit health checks passing.

### Recovery Process

#### Step 1: Database Recovery
```bash
docker-compose up -d
# Successfully started PostgreSQL container
```

#### Step 2: Server Startup Attempts
**Attempt 1 - Normal Dev Start:**
```bash
sleep 3 && npm run dev
# Command timed out after 2m 0.0s
# Server appeared to start but hung during process
```

**Attempt 2 - Emergency Recovery:**
```bash
npm run emergency
# Command timed out after 2m 0.0s Terminated
# Emergency recovery also hung
```

**Attempt 3 - Simple Mode:**
```bash
npm run dev:simple
# Command timed out after 2m 0.0s
# Again hung despite showing startup messages
```

**Attempt 4 - Direct Node Start:**
```bash
node dist/server/index.js &
# Command timed out after 2m 0.0s
# But server actually started successfully in background
```

### Final Resolution
Server was actually running despite command timeouts. Health checks confirmed:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/health
# {"status":"ok","database":"connected","timestamp":"2025-06-30T22:22:33.779Z"}

curl -s http://localhost:3000/ | head -5
# HTML page rendered correctly with updated metadata
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Symptoms Observed
1. **Silent Failure**: Server and DB stopped without obvious trigger
2. **Command Timeouts**: All npm scripts hung for 2+ minutes
3. **Misleading Output**: Server showed startup messages but commands timed out
4. **Background Success**: Direct node command worked when backgrounded

### Potential Causes
1. **Process Management**: npm scripts may have process hanging issues
2. **Port Conflicts**: Previous processes may not have cleaned up properly
3. **Resource Contention**: Memory or CPU issues during commit process
4. **Signal Handling**: Improper process termination during pre-commit checks

### Context
- Issue occurred immediately after successful commit: `2981331`
- Pre-commit health checks passed (4.1s startup time reported)
- No code changes to server logic, only HTML metadata updates
- Docker containers stopped unexpectedly

## Current Workarounds

### Reliable Startup Method
```bash
# 1. Start database
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Start server in background
node dist/server/index.js &

# 3. Verify health
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Port Cleanup
```bash
# Kill processes on port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || echo "Port 3000 is free"

# Kill specific server processes  
pkill -f "node.*dist/server" || echo "No processes killed"
```

## Recommendations for Investigation

### High Priority
1. **Review npm script process management** - Why do they hang?
2. **Investigate pre-commit test side effects** - Does health check leave processes?
3. **Add timeout handling** to development scripts
4. **Improve error reporting** in startup scripts

### Medium Priority  
1. **Process monitoring** - Add health checks that detect hung states
2. **Graceful shutdown** - Ensure clean process termination
3. **Resource monitoring** - Check for memory/CPU issues during startup
4. **Container stability** - Why did containers stop unexpectedly?

### Immediate Improvements
1. Add process timeout handling to npm scripts
2. Implement better error messages for hung processes
3. Create reliable startup script that detects and handles issues
4. Add monitoring to detect when services go down

## Files to Review
- `package.json` - npm script definitions
- `scripts/check-port.js` - port checking logic
- `src/__tests__/infrastructure/pre-commit-startup.test.ts` - health check behavior
- `docker-compose.yml` - container configuration

## Status
- **Immediate Issue**: Resolved (server and DB running)
- **Root Cause**: Unknown - requires investigation
- **Risk Level**: Medium - could impact development workflow
- **Next Steps**: Schedule debugging session to improve server reliability
