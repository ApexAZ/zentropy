# Security Vulnerability Fixes - Unified Verification System

## Overview
Two critical security vulnerabilities were discovered through comprehensive integration testing and have been successfully resolved.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Cross-User Token Prevention ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Operation tokens could be used by different users than they were issued for
**Risk**: High - Users could potentially hijack other users' password reset/change operations
**Fix**: Enhanced token verification to validate that token email matches the authenticated user's email

### 2. Single-Use Token Enforcement ✅ FIXED  
**Issue**: Operation tokens could be reused multiple times
**Risk**: High - Replay attacks possible, tokens could be reused after being compromised
**Fix**: Added database tracking of used tokens via `UsedOperationToken` model

## Implementation Details

### Database Changes
- Added `UsedOperationToken` table to track consumed tokens
- Indexes added for efficient cleanup and lookup operations

### API Changes
- Enhanced `verify_operation_token()` function with optional database session and user ID parameters
- Updated all security endpoints to use enhanced token validation:
  - `/api/v1/auth/reset-password`
  - `/api/v1/users/me/secure-change-password` 
  - `/api/v1/auth/recover-username`

### Security Exception Types Added
- `TokenAlreadyUsedError`: Raised when attempting to reuse a consumed token
- `TokenUserMismatchError`: Raised when token email doesn't match authenticated user

## Testing
- **21 integration tests** now passing (previously 19 passing, 2 xfailed)
- Tests validate both security fixes work correctly
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Cross-user token prevention validated through authenticated endpoints
- Single-use token enforcement validated through token reuse attempts

## Impact
- **Zero backward compatibility issues**: New security features are opt-in via database session parameter
- **Performance**: Minimal impact - single database query per token verification when security is enabled
- **Security posture**: Significantly improved - eliminates two high-risk attack vectors

## Files Modified
- `api/security.py` - Enhanced token verification with security checks
- `api/database.py` - Added UsedOperationToken model and required imports
- `api/routers/auth.py` - Updated password reset and username recovery endpoints
- `api/routers/users.py` - Updated secure password change endpoint
- `tests/integration/test_unified_verification.py` - Updated tests to verify fixes

## Validation Commands
```bash
# Run integration tests to verify security fixes
python3 -m pytest tests/integration/test_unified_verification.py -v

# Run security-specific tests
python3 -m pytest tests/security/ -v

# Verify specific security fixes
python3 -m pytest tests/integration/test_unified_verification.py::TestOperationTokenSecurity -v
```

All tests pass, confirming the security vulnerabilities have been successfully resolved.
