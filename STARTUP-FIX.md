# Startup Fix - Final Simple Solution

## The Problem
Complex process management through npm scripts was causing servers to exit unexpectedly due to:
- Python output buffering
- Node.js process lifecycle issues
- npm's child process handling

## The Solution

We now use `concurrently` directly in the npm script with the right flags:

```json
"dev": "docker-compose up -d && PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 concurrently --raw --kill-others --success first --names \"API,CLIENT\" -c \"yellow,cyan\" \"npm run dev:api\" \"npm run dev:client\""
```

This works because:
- `docker-compose up -d` - Ensures database is running first
- `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` - Makes Python output visible immediately
- `concurrently` - Properly manages multiple processes
- `--raw` - Prevents output buffering issues
- `--kill-others` - Clean shutdown when stopping
- `--success first` - Keeps running after initial success
- `--names` - Clear labeling of API vs CLIENT output

## Usage

**Start everything:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Stop everything:**
```bash
npm run stop
```

**Check ports:**
```bash
npm run dev:check
```

## What's Running

1. **Database**: PostgreSQL in Docker container (port 5432)
2. **API Server**: Python FastAPI with uvicorn (port 3000)
3. **Client Dev Server**: Vite for React (port 5173)

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI - More stable and reliable than Node.js for APIs
- **Frontend**: React with Vite - Best-in-class JavaScript tooling
- **Database**: PostgreSQL - Production-ready relational database

## Scripts Kept

Only essential scripts remain in `/scripts`:
- `check-ports.js` - Verify ports are available
- `stop.js` - Clean shutdown of all services
- `setup-database.sh` - Initial database setup

## Common Issues

**Ports already in use:**
```bash
npm run stop
# or manually:
pkill -f uvicorn && pkill -f vite
```

**Database not starting:**
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

**First time setup:**
```bash
npm install
npm run install:python
./scripts/setup-database.sh
```

## Why This Works

The key insight: Keep it simple. Instead of complex process management in Node.js, we use `concurrently` which is purpose-built for this exact use case. The Python backend provides stability, while React/Vite provides excellent developer experience.
