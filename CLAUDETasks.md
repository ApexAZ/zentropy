# Project Tasks and Development Roadmap

This file contains project roadmap, development tasks, priorities, and implementation tracking for the Zentropy Product Management platform. This is a living document that should be updated regularly.

## Development Standards and Patterns

### Task Management Standards
- **Timestamp Requirement**: All tasks and sub-tasks must include date and time stamps when added
- **Completion Tracking**: Include completion timestamps for all finished tasks and sub-tasks  
- **Format Standard**: Use format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (timezone)" for consistency
- **Status Tracking**: Include start times, completion times, and duration calculations where applicable
- **Progress Documentation**: Maintain clear task progression history for project planning and retrospectives

### Quality Workflow Standards
- **âš¡ Quality Check Process**: After each sub-task completion
  - `npm test` - Verify all tests pass (target: 100% success rate)
  - `npm run lint` - Ensure ESLint compliance (target: 0 errors)
  - `npm run type-check` - Verify TypeScript safety (target: 0 errors)
  - `npm run format` - Apply code formatting consistency
- **ðŸ“‹ Commit Process**: Every 2 completed sub-tasks
  - Run complete quality check pipeline
  - Create descriptive commit message with feature summary
  - Include progress tracking and task completion details
- **ðŸ”„ Continuous Integration**: Maintain test reliability throughout development
- **ðŸ“ˆ Quality Metrics**: Track improvement in test count, ESLint compliance, and system stability

### Vertical Slice Development Standards (INVEST)

#### INVEST Criteria for All Feature Development
- **Independent**: Each slice should be self-contained and not dependent on other unfinished slices
- **Negotiable**: Scope can be adjusted based on learning and feedback during implementation
- **Valuable**: Each slice delivers working functionality that users can actually test and interact with
- **Estimable**: Slice scope should be small enough to complete and test within a reasonable timeframe
- **Small**: Keep slices minimal - focus on core functionality, avoid feature creep
- **Testable**: Each slice must include both automated tests and manual functional testing

#### Vertical Slice Structure Requirements
- **Full Stack**: Every slice must include database â†’ API â†’ frontend â†’ tests
- **End-to-End Functionality**: Users should be able to complete a real workflow through the web interface
- **Immediate Feedback**: Each slice should be demonstrable and testable upon completion
- **Iterative Validation**: Validate assumptions and gather feedback before building the next slice
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Each slice builds upon previous functionality without breaking existing features
