Strict quality first attitude.  
Never try to run npm run dev; ask the user to do it if it's needed.

Read the following documents and make sure you understand the standards:

CLAUDE.md
README.md
tests/README.md
tests-e2e/README.md
architecture/README.md
examples/README.md

Also, make a note of the Project Documentation section in the main README.md if you need more specific details on front end or back end development.
