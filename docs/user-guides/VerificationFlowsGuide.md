# Email Verification Flows User Guide

## Overview

Zentropy uses secure email verification for all security-sensitive operations to protect your account. This guide explains how to use the various verification flows, what to expect, and how to troubleshoot common issues.

## üîê Why Email Verification?

Email verification adds an extra layer of security to sensitive operations:

- **Password Changes**: Verify it's really you changing your password
- **Password Resets**: Securely reset forgotten passwords
- **Account Changes**: Confirm important account modifications

All verification flows use **6-digit codes** sent to your email that expire in **10 minutes** for your security.
