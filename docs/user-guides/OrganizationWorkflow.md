- **Leave organization**: Available anytime (except for sole creators)
- **Switch organizations**: Leave current org first, then join another

#### Finding Organization Administrators

When you need to contact your organization administrator for capacity increases, permission changes, or other administrative requests:

**Identifying Administrators**:
1. **Organization Creator**: The person who originally created the organization
   - Has full administrative privileges
   - Can modify organization settings and capacity
   - Listed as "Creator" in organization member list

2. **Admin Users**: Users with administrative roles
   - May have been granted admin privileges by the creator

   - Look for users marked as "Creator" or "Admin"
   - Note their names for contact lookup

2. **Use Company Resources**:
   - **Company directory**: Search internal employee directory
   - **Email system**: Look up admin users by name
   - **Team communication**: Check Slack, Teams, or similar platforms
   - **HR resources**: Contact HR if you can't locate administrators

3. **Alternative Contact Methods**:
   - **Project collaborators**: Ask teammates who might know the admin

- **Organization required**: Yes (automatic assignment if not already a member)
- **Use cases**: Collaborative work, shared tasks, team goals
- **Access**: Requires organization membership

### Organization Projects

## Advanced Workflows

### Multi-Project Management

You can maintain both personal and team projects simultaneously:

```
Personal Projects:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìù Personal Notes (Personal visibility)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üéØ Career Goals (Personal visibility)

Organization Projects:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üè¢ Team Roadmap (Team visibility)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìä Quarterly Planning (Organization visibility)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üöÄ Product Launch (Team visibility)
```

### Organization Switching

If you need to work with multiple organizations:

1. **Leave current organization**: Projects ‚Üí Organization ‚Üí Leave
2. **Join new organization**: Use domain discovery or join by invitation
3. **Note**: Personal projects remain accessible; organization projects become inaccessible

### Domain-Independent Collaboration

You can join organizations outside your email domain:

1. Get organization ID from team administrator
2. Use direct join link or manual join process
3. System allows cross-domain collaboration for flexibility

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

### "I want to start collaborating but don't see organization options"

**Solution**: Create a team project first. This triggers the organization discovery workflow.

### "My organization is full/at capacity"

**Solutions**:
- Contact organization administrator to increase capacity
- Administrator can remove inactive members
- Create a new organization if needed

**Finding Your Organization Administrator**:
1. Navigate to **Organization** ‚Üí **Settings** or **Members**
2. Look for users with "Admin" or "Creator" badges
3. The organization creator is typically the primary administrator
4. Contact them through:
   - Internal company directory/email
   - Team communication tools (Slack, Teams, etc.)
   - Direct message if available in your company system

### "I accidentally joined the wrong organization"

**Solution**: 
1. Leave the current organization
2. Join the correct organization
3. Note: Organization projects from the previous org become inaccessible

### "I want to convert a personal project to a team project"

**Current behavior**: Create a new team project and transfer content manually
**Future enhancement**: Direct project visibility conversion

### "I'm the sole organization creator and want to leave"

**Solution**: 
1. Transfer ownership to another member (if system supports)
2. Or delete the organization entirely
3. All organization projects will be removed
