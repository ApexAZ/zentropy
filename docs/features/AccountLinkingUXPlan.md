# Account Linking UX Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for bridging the gap between Zentropy's complete backend account linking infrastructure and the missing frontend user experience. While the backend provides robust Google OAuth account linking functionality, users currently have no way to access these features through the UI.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ Backend Infrastructure (Complete)
- **API Endpoints**: Full REST API for account security management
  - `GET /api/v1/users/me/security` - Get account security status
  - `POST /api/v1/users/me/link-google` - Link Google OAuth account
  - `POST /api/v1/users/me/unlink-google` - Remove Google OAuth account
- **Security Models**: Robust AuthProvider enum (LOCAL, GOOGLE, HYBRID)
- **Database Schema**: Complete with google_id field and provider tracking
- **Validation**: Email verification matching and conflict prevention
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage (957 frontend + 601 backend tests)

### ❌ Frontend User Experience (Missing Entirely)
- **No UI Components**: Zero frontend implementation for account linking
- **No Service Integration**: UserService lacks security endpoint methods
- **No User Discovery**: No navigation or access points to security features
- **No Visual Feedback**: No indication of current authentication status
- **No UX Patterns**: Missing error handling, loading states, confirmations

## Critical UX Gaps

### 1. Complete User Access Barrier
Users have no way to discover or access account linking functionality despite robust backend support. The ProfilePage exists but contains no security management section.

### 2. Missing Service Layer Integration
The frontend UserService lacks essential methods:
- `getAccountSecurity()` - Retrieve current authentication status
- `linkGoogleAccount()` - Link Google OAuth to existing account
- `unlinkGoogleAccount()` - Remove Google OAuth authentication

### 3. No Visual Authentication Status
Users cannot see:
- Current authentication provider (Email only vs Email + Google)
- Security status indicators or badges
- Recommendations for improving account security

### 4. Missing UX Safety Patterns
- No confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (unlinking)
- No password verification UI for sensitive operations
- No progress indicators during linking operations
- No success/error state management
