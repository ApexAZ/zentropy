#defects as of 07/10/2025

✅ Fixed: Create Account button now works - issue was Vite proxy configuration with regex patterns needed for proper API routing
✅ Fixed: test_phase7_edge_cases.py renamed to test_organization_edge_cases.py and test_integration_phase6.py renamed to test_integration_organization_workflows.py - descriptive names now reflect actual test content rather than implementation phases
✅ Fixed: Test organization structure improved - moved integration tests to tests/integration/ and OAuth-specific tests to tests/oauth/ following documented directory structure guidelines
When using the sign in modal with email, there is no indicator if account isn't found
