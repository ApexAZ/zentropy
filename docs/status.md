# Project Status & TODO Tracking

This document tracks the current project status, technical debt, and planned improvements for the Zentropy codebase.

## Current System State

 **PRODUCTION-READY SECURITY ENHANCEMENT** - Comprehensive rate limiting protection, enhanced email verification UX, OAuth session persistence, and test stability achieved with zero-tolerance quality standards.

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: 91.77% backend, 92.65% frontend (both above 80% threshold)  
- **Test Results**: All quality pipeline checks pass (1772 total tests: 594 backend + 1178 frontend)
- **Security Coverage**: All authentication endpoints protected with appropriate rate limiting
- **Production Readiness**: Zero errors, warnings, or linting issues across entire codebase

## =Ë CURRENT TODO LIST

### Code Quality & Technical Debt

#### 1. **Eliminate Legacy Code**
- **Status**: =4 Not Corrected
- **Priority**: High
- **Specifics**: The file `src/client/hooks/useFormValidation.ts` still contains the function `useFormValidationLegacy`. This function represents technical debt and creates two different ways of handling forms in the codebase.
- **Impact**: This leads to inconsistent form behavior and creates confusion for developers on which hook to use.
- **Proposed Solution**: Migrate any components still using `useFormValidationLegacy` to the modern `useFormValidation` hook and delete the legacy code.
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours
- **Dependencies**: None

#### 2. **Simplify Google OAuth**
- **Status**: =4 Not Corrected  
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Specifics**: The `src/client/hooks/useGoogleOAuth.ts` hook still contains a complex, manual implementation that uses `setInterval` and `setTimeout` to poll for the existence of the `window.google` object. The `package.json` file confirms that a dedicated library like `@react-oauth/google` has not been added.
- **Impact**: This manual approach is brittle, harder to maintain, and reinvents functionality that is handled more robustly by specialized libraries.
- **Proposed Solution**: Replace the custom hook with a well-maintained library like `@react-oauth/google` to simplify the code and improve reliability.
- **Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours
- **Dependencies**: Need to evaluate library compatibility with current auth flow

#### 3. **Refactor AuthModal.tsx**
- **Status**: =á Partially Corrected
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Specifics**: The `AuthModal.tsx` component was simplified by removing the method-selection mode. However, it remains a large, monolithic component that still contains the full logic and JSX for both `renderSignIn` and `renderSignUp`. The `useEffect` hooks still contain `eslint-disable-next-line` comments to avoid infinite loops, which is a sign of overly complex state interactions.
- **Impact**: The component is still difficult to modify and debug. A change to the sign-in form could unintentionally affect the sign-up form.
- **Proposed Solution**: Break the component into smaller, single-responsibility components: `AuthModal` (as the shell), `SignInForm`, and `SignUpForm`.
- **Estimated Effort**: 6-8 hours
- **Dependencies**: Need to address accessibility issues (missing htmlFor attributes) during refactor

#### 4. **Adopt a State Management Library**
- **Status**: =4 Not Corrected
- **Priority**: High
- **Specifics**: The main `App.tsx` component still manages a large amount of global state using `useState`, including `currentPage`, `showAuthModal`, `authModalMode`, `showVerificationPage`, and `verificationEmail`. These state variables and their setters are passed down as props to child components (Header, AuthModal, etc.), which is a pattern known as prop drilling.
- **Impact**: `App.tsx` is a bottleneck for state, making it complex and hard to maintain. Adding new global features will further bloat this component.
- **Proposed Solution**: Introduce a lightweight state management library like Zustand to create a central store for this global state, which will significantly simplify `App.tsx` and decouple the components.
- **Estimated Effort**: 8-12 hours
- **Dependencies**: Need to choose between Zustand, Jotai, or Context API enhancement

#### 5. **Introduce a Routing Library**
- **Status**: =4 Not Corrected
- **Priority**: High
- **Specifics**: In `App.tsx`, navigation is handled by a `renderPage` function that uses a switch statement based on the `currentPage` state variable.
- **Impact**: This manual routing system is not scalable and does not support standard web application features like nested routes, URL parameters (e.g., `/teams/:id`), or a declarative API.
- **Proposed Solution**: Replace the manual switch-based routing with the industry-standard `react-router-dom` library for a more robust and scalable navigation architecture.
- **Estimated Effort**: 12-16 hours
- **Dependencies**: Major refactor of App.tsx and all page components

### Feature Enhancements

#### 6. **Add password reset functionality to profile page**
- **Status**: =5 Planned
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Question**: How should user information be organized? Security, personal information, etc?
- **Proposed Solution**: Create a comprehensive user settings page with sections for security, profile, and preferences.
- **Estimated Effort**: 8-10 hours
- **Dependencies**: Need to design information architecture

#### 7. **User name and Password recovery functions**
- **Status**: =5 Planned
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Question**: Use our centralized code system?
- **Proposed Solution**: Integrate with existing email verification system and use centralized validation patterns.
- **Estimated Effort**: 6-8 hours
- **Dependencies**: Email service integration

#### 8. **Account merge function implementation**
- **Status**: =5 Planned
- **Priority**: Low
- **Question**: How to use the account merge function if a user starts with email registration, but wants to start using OAuth instead?
- **Reference**: See `docs/OrgImplementation.md` for more details
- **Proposed Solution**: Create a guided flow for linking OAuth accounts to existing email accounts.
- **Estimated Effort**: 10-12 hours
- **Dependencies**: OAuth flow redesign

#### 9. **Enhanced rate limiting UX**
- **Status**: =5 Planned
- **Priority**: Low
- **Specifics**: Add another state to disable resend verification button completely with a new label indicating the lockout
- **Proposed Solution**: Improve button states and messaging when hourly limits are exceeded to provide clearer user feedback.
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
- **Dependencies**: None

### Architecture Improvements (From Recent Analysis)

#### 10. **Implement Missing Atomic Design Documentation**
- **Status**: =4 Not Documented
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Specifics**: Component library lacks comprehensive documentation for atomic design patterns
- **Impact**: New developers struggle to understand component hierarchy and composition patterns
- **Proposed Solution**: Create detailed component library documentation with examples and usage guidelines
- **Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours

#### 11. **Standardize Error Boundary Implementation**
- **Status**: =4 Missing Implementation
- **Priority**: High
- **Specifics**: No error boundaries implemented for graceful error handling in production
- **Impact**: App crashes propagate to users, poor user experience
- **Proposed Solution**: Implement error boundaries following the pattern identified in architecture analysis
- **Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours

#### 12. **Enhance Performance Optimization Patterns**
- **Status**: =á Partial Implementation
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Specifics**: Inconsistent memoization patterns across components
- **Impact**: Unnecessary re-renders in complex components
- **Proposed Solution**: Audit and standardize memoization patterns, implement component optimization guidelines
- **Estimated Effort**: 6-8 hours

#### 13. **Configuration Management Standardization**
- **Status**: =4 Needs Documentation
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Specifics**: Environment variable patterns not clearly documented
- **Impact**: Deployment configuration errors and security risks
- **Proposed Solution**: Document configuration patterns and create validation helpers
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
